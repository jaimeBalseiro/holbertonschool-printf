# **`printf`**


>Write your own `printf` function.


## Description
printf blah blah here :)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

## Format Specifiers

## Project Requirements
-  Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-  All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
-  Your programs and functions will be compiled with `(Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) gcc 9.4.0`
   using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` `and -pedantic`
-  All your files should end with a new line
-  A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
-  Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl") and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
-  You are not allowed to use global variables
-  No more that 5 functions per file
-  In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo (if you do we won't take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
-  The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file `main.h`
-  Don't forget to push yur header file
-  All your header files should be included guarded
-  Note that we will not provide the `_putchar` function for this project

## Authorized functions and macros
   ```bash
   write (man 2 write)
   ```
   ```bash
   malloc (man 3 malloc)
   ```
   ```bash
   free (man 3 free)
   ```
   ```bash
   va_start (man 3 va_start)
   ```
   ```bash
   va_end (man 3 va_end)
   ```
   ```bash
   va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
   ```
   ```bash
   va_arg (man 3 va_arg)
   ```

### Prototype
#include "main.h"
```bash
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
```
### Compilation
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
```
